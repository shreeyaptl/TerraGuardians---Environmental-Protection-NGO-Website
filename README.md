## Overview

This repository contains the complete front-end code for **TerraGuardians**, a fictional Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) dedicated to environmental protection. The website serves as a compelling digital presence for the organization, designed to inform visitors about global environmental challenges, showcase core programs, highlight impact, and inspire action towards a sustainable future.

The primary goal of this project was to create a visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive web experience that effectively communicates the NGO's mission and encourages engagement from supporters and volunteers.
